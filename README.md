# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Play as your local school nerd against a Netflix-teen-sized School Bully in a heated match of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

This game will keep track of you and your opponents moves and their respective outcomes as well as increase or 
decrease in difficulty depending on how you're doing.

What I learned:
- How to randomly select elements from an array
- How to manipulate probability using a single random value and ranges
- A simple way to collect data on a games progression
- flexboxes
